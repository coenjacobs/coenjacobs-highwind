# Coen Jacobs' child theme for Highwind
This is my personal child theme for the [Highwind theme by @jameskoster](https://github.com/jameskoster/highwind) and is released on an *as is* basis. I got a lot of questions about how I changed the header on [my site](http://coenjacobs.me), so I figured it would be easiest for me to just whack it on here and refer people to the right code.

There might be some content in some of the files, so this is probably not a good theme to download and start using. If you are a fan of the Highwind theme and want to look into customising it, my child theme might hold some parts you can use or that might inspire you.
